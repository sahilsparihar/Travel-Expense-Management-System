Here's an example of a basic travel expense management system implemented in Java. 
Please note that this code is a simplified version and may not include all the necessary error handling or additional features you may want to incorporate. 
It should serve as a starting point for your implementation.
In this example, the Expense class represents an individual expense, with a description and an amount. 
The ExpenseManager class manages a collection of expenses, allowing you to add new expenses and display the existing ones, along with the total amount.

The TravelExpenseManagementSystem class serves as the entry point of the program. 
It creates an instance of ExpenseManager and provides a simple menu-driven interface for adding expenses, displaying them, or exiting the program.

Please note that this is a basic implementation, and you may need to enhance it based on our specific requirements and add features like data persistence,
user authentication, or more advanced expense management capabilities.
